## Problem 2.3: Hartals[^1]

### Problem description
This program calculates the number of days lost due to hartals (strikes) over a certain length of time. For each party, their Hartals occur at a fixed rate - for example, every four days. Their are no Hartals on either Fridays or Saturdays. The simulation always begins on a Sunday.
The first line of input contains an integer defining the number of test cases.
The first line of each test case contains the number of days over which to calculate the days lost. This number must be within the range \[7, 3650\]. The next line is the number of political parties that stage the Hartals, this number must be within the range \[1, 100\].
Finally the next several (number of political parties) lines contain the hartal parameters of each party.


### Example 
> **Input**         
>2      
>14        
>3       
>3        
>4        
>8        
>100        
>4         
>12        
>15        
>25        
>40                      

>**Output**          
>5      
>15
